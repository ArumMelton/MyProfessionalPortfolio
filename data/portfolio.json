I have been developing software since April of 2022. It has been an amazing experience that has sparked many emotions for me. I am also a full time music producer, audio engineer, and DJ. Combing the skills of software with music have been a dream of mine for a long time, and fortunately enough, I have finally begun the journey. I am based in Raleigh, NC but travel for just about any project across all disciplines, platforms, and creative mediums.
